hand.py is the method of manual feature extraction
t5.py is the method for embedding feature extraction
train.csv and test.csv are the training and test sets, respectively
trainmodel and testmodel are the training and testing code, respectively
pkl files are the extracted features and labels
Some extracted features cannot be uploaded because the files are too large. You can use the code I uploaded to extract them yourself or contact me directly. In addition, if you have any questions, please contact me in time and I will reply you at the first time. This is my email address 2418538981@qq.com
